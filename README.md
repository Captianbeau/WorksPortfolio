# WorksPortfolio

## Description
This is a portfolio of the deployed apps I made while I was in school.  It has sections to describe myself, link to my work, show my resume and allow users to email me.  This application will be updated periodically with up to date information about myself so that any future employers can look at it and get an idea of my skills.
